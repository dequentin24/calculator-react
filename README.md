# Calculator App

# Why did I make this app?
This was just a test (with the help of a tutorial) that allowed me to see if operators can be manipulated through functions. Its basically showing me that its possible to calaute using basic operators through react.

# How's it made
I created a function call updateCalc that takes each operator and calulates numerical values after being attached to a button (onClick) I also created a function (delete last) that slices a number from the type value.
